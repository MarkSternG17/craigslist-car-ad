	<h3>The typical user, looking for a new or used car, will navigate to their local <a href="http://albuquerque.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> page and follow the link for "cars+trucks" to browse the listings.</h3>
		<h4>For this project I will focus on the buyer persona only.</h4>A buyer is typically:
		<ul>
			<li>Looking to buy a car.</li>
			<li>May need a new car or may be looking for a specific car.</li>
			<li>Generally speaking, an auto buyer on Craigslist does not need/want help financing a car.</li>
			<li>Most users prefer an aggregated listing of vehicles before traveling to purchase one.</li>
		</ul>
	</body>
	<body>
		<p>In this case the buyer has decided they are interested in the 1975 Chevy Monte Carlo below</p>

		<h4>Once a buyer makes his/her choice, they are presented with several options to initiate a conversation between the buyer and seller.</h4>
			<p>The "reply" button produces a drop-down menu that provides:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Seller's name</li>
			<li>Phone number</li>
			<li>Email address (either secure through Craigslist or personal</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If the buyer, or anyone browsing the listing for that matter, notices any reason the listing should be taken down, they simply click on the "prohibited" box.
		Craigslist will examine the listing and make the final determination. <strong>Some reasons for clicking the "prohibited" button are:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>A buyer has discovered that the vehicle pictured is not the actual vehicle for sale.</li>
			<li>There is offensive language/profanity within the listing.</li>
			<li>Perhaps a savvy car buyer notices details (on the right of the page) that do not match the specific Year, Make or Model of the vehicle.</li>
		</ul>
	</body>
	<body>
		<p>Craigslist provides other useful options for buyers such as the ability to go to the previous and next listings with a simple click of a hyperlink,
			an option to print the page and even a map shpwing the general area the vehicle is located (which is helpful if a buyer doesn't want to drive further than a certain
		ditance).</p>
		<p><strong>But the details matter!</strong><br>Navigating to the right side of a listing page shows you many useful details of the car you are considering:</p>
