	<body>
	<h3>The typical user, looking for a new or used car, will navigate to their local <a href="http://albuquerque.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> page and follow the link for "cars+trucks" to browse the listings.</h3>
		<h4>For this project I will focus on the buyer persona only.</h4>A buyer is typically:
		<ul>
			<li>Looking to buy a car.</li>
			<li>May need a new car or may be looking for a specific car.</li>
			<li>Generally speaking, an auto buyer on Craigslist does not need/want help financing a car.</li>
		</ul>
